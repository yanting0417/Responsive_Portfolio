**ðŸŽ¨ Personal Portfolio Website**

Welcome to my responsive portfolio website! 
- This portfolio is inspired by a fantastic tutorial from [How to Become a Developer's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldwlOzRvYOU&t=16s).
- I've customized it with my unique style and details to make it my own.
- The menu bar is fixed at the top of the page for easy navigation.
